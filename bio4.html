    <div style='background-position: -640px -320px;' class='speaker-image speaker-bio-image'></div>Jim Cowart is a web developer, tragically geeky about JavaScript, HTML5, open source, hybrid mobile development...but he's not a fan of lists, so we'll stop there. Having journeyed through Cold Fusion, an obscure proprietary JavaScript BI implementation, C#, a smidgeon of Erlang (&lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3) and even spent some time as a data warehouse architect and developer (apparently he lied to us about not liking lists), he's most passionate about connecting with other developers – learning, sharing and promoting patterns and ideas that will make development more productive, enjoyable and empowering. Jim lives in Chattanooga with his wife and two sons, and will be happy to make epic restaurant recommendations to any devLink attendees. He works for Telerik as a Developer Advocate for Icenium, and you can follow him on twitter - @ifandelse.

    <div style='background-position: -480px -400px;' class='speaker-image speaker-bio-image'></div>John Petersen has been developing software for over 20 years. It all started when, as a staff accountant, he was asked to get involved in a system upgrade to replace an old IBM Series 1 computer (about the size of a large refrigerator!). Those first programs were written in Clipper, summer 87. Since that time, tools included dBase, FoxBase, Visual FoxPro and Visual Basic. An early adopter of .NET, he then decided to go to law school.

A 9 time recipient of Microsoft’s Most Valuable Professional Award, John is a current ASP.NET/IIS MVP. John is also an ASP Insider and is the INETA Mentor for PA and WV.
