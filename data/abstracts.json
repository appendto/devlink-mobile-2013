How can you always ensure asynchronous code is executed within a digest loop without having to check? Should you store commonly referenced variables in $rootScope or a service? How do you ensure promises are resolved before your controller is invoked? \r\n\r\nIn this talk, Jeremy Likness covers advanced tips, tricks, and techniques for building Angular apps.

		"summary": "A key concept of any Agile methodology is communication. It&#x2019;s no longer normal or acceptable for developers to sit and develop applications in isolation from the business. To that end, developers and business domain experts have been trying to find better ways to communicate. While developers tend to speak in terms of &#x201C;code and technology&#x201D; most business domain experts are more comfortable communicating in terms of scenarios, workflows and business rules.\r\n\r\nTest Driven Development (TDD) was the first step in getting these two groups to communicate in the same way. Developers could write unit tests that expressed business requirements with the hope that business users could validate that what was being tested was in fact what the desired behavior was. But, unit tests are still code and while it was better, the communication was still stilted and inefficient.\r\n\r\nTo help this communication new techniques such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) have become popular. Along with these new ideas, new tools like SpecFlow have become popular as a means to express unit tests in a way that the business can better understand and validate.\r\n\r\nThis session will demonstrate how SpecFlow can be leveraged in your BDD or ATDD practices. The Gherkin language and the &#x201C;Given, When, Then&#x201D; paradigm will be explained and you will see how to write tests in a way that business users are not only capable of reading, but can also help you create them.\r\n",

They don&apos;t notice how often they mutter &quot;..how&apos;d he implement that..&quot; or &quot;..where&apos;s that method that does X?&quot;  They don&apos;t notice that the search tool they use to answer these questions is from the 1960s. They don&apos;t even seem to notice that 90% of these type of searches fail! Fortunately, a developer turned researcher did notice, and has dedicated the better part of the last decade to eliminating this quiet productivity-killer.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I&apos;ll use both video examples and a massive repository of real developer activity data to prove that the typically-used regex search tools waste a significant part of your day.  Yet this talk won&apos;t dwell on the past; it focuses squarely on a better search future. I&apos;ll provide a tour of Visual Studio&apos;s many built in searches, demonstrate two search tools available as extensions, provide guidelines for better searching, and even demonstrate server-based search tools. By attending this talk you will become a more effective searcher, a skill that is surprisingly fundamental to software development, and I estimate you can eliminate 10-30% waste from an average sprint.\r\n\r\nhttp://channel9.msdn.com/coding4fun/blog/F3-is-so-yesterday-The-Sando-Visual-Studio-Extension-provides-real-code-indexing-search-and-more\r\n",

But if you want to take your skills to the next level, it&#x2019;s critical to know SQL Server&#x2019;s internal processes and architecture.  This session will answer questions like:\r\n\r\n-\tWhat are the various areas of memory inside of SQL Server?\r\n-\tHow are queries handled behind the scenes?\r\n-\tWhat does SQL Server do with procedural code, like functions, procedures, and triggers?\r\n-\tWhat happens during checkpoints?  Lazywrites?\r\n-\tHow are IOs handled with regards to transaction logs and database?\r\n-\tWhat happens when transaction logs and databases grow or shrinks?\r\n\r\nThis fast paced session will take you through many aspects of the internal operations of SQL Server and, for those topics we don&#x2019;t cover, will point you to resources where you can get more information.  So strap on your silly, as we cover all these topics and more at speed with tongue planted firmly in cheek! ",

And it doesn&#x2019;t mean that database administration on SQL Server is problem free. And since many of us fall into the role of database administrator without professional training, we end up encountering issues that others solved years ago. Why not learn from those who first blazed the trails of database administration, so that we don&#x2019;t make the same mistakes over and over again? \r\n\r\nThis session will answer questions like:\r\n\r\n-\tWhat are some of the strengths of SQL Server then also turn out to be weaknesses?\r\n-\tWhy do inexperienced database administrators make their own job more difficult and less efficient? \r\n-\tWhat is the one thing that DBAs and Devs always clash over?\r\n-\tWhat&apos;s the one mistake likely to get a DBA fired?\r\n\r\nThere is a short list of mistakes that, if you know of them in advance, will make your life much easier.  These mistakes are the &#x201C;low hanging fruit&#x201D; of application design, development, and administration.  Once you apply the lessons learned from this session, you&#x2019;ll find yourself performing at a higher level of efficiency and effectiveness than before.\r\n",

From a backup standpoint Azure offers services to backup VMs via Azure Hyper-V Recovery Manager, and to backup data using Azure Recovery Services.  The Azure Scheduler gives you the ability to schedule jobs that can run both within and external to Azure. Traffic Manager supports both PaaS and IaaS configurations based upon round robin, failover, and performance metrics. Management Services gives you the ability to set up billing alerts, as well as service alerts for services, storage, and web sites and run queries on the results. Virtual Machine Auto-Scaling has been improved to now give you configurable options for both PaaS Cloud Services, Web sites, and IaaS VMs. Azure BizTalk Services integrates the enterprise and the Azure Cloud by configuring B2B messaging.  HDInsight is Azure&#x2019;s solution to bring big data processing to the Azure Cloud. Improvements to Azure Storage include read-only access to geo-replicated storage, improved storage analytics, and allowing the transfer of large amounts of data via physical drive using the Azure Import and Export Service.  For Web sites we look at the recent enhancements of AlwaysOn Support, Web Jobs, and Staged Publishing.\r\n\r\nJoin Aditi Senior Cloud Solutions Architect and Microsoft Azure MVP Mike McKeown as he offers guidance and best practices to most effectively administer your Azure deployments.\r\n",

		"summary": "This talk caters to both the neophyte and the initiated IT Professional working with SQL Server within the Microsoft Azure IaaS VM environment.  First we get a single instance of SQL Server up and running in the Azure Cloud.  There are key concepts around configuring and managing Azure disks and images that run SQL Server.  After we have images or disks we look at the four primary choice for installing and configuring SQL Server in Azure IaaS to ensure you have a basic working configuration. From there we quickly pick up the pace and jump into advanced topics for optimizing SQL Server 2012 performance and availability on Azure IaaS. Topics include optimizing SQL Server disk IOPS performance by optimizing Azure storage and the provisioning of disks to maximize SQL Server performance. We&#x2019;ll discuss Azure geo-replication of data relates to multi-disk layouts and storage IOPs.  We will discuss how to properly configuring host caching for data and OS disks, how to format disks optimally for azure, managing lifetime of disks, and how to handle disks larger than 1 TB. We will look at how to utilize some Azure IaaS concepts such as affinity groups, virtual networks and their associated subnets, and best practices around VM connectivity to maximize the performance and minimize latency of SQL Server on Azure IaaS.   We will expand upon the simple Internet SQL Server administration model to show how best to secure remote administration leveraging the benefits of a virtual network.  Using a combination of availability sets, load-balancing endpoints, and affinity groups helps ensure that your application is always available and running as fast and efficiently as possible. \r\n\r\nJoin Aditi Senior Cloud Solutions Architect and Microsoft Azure MVP Mike McKeown as he offers guidance and lessons learned to most effectively manage and deploy SQL Server on Microsoft Azure IaaS.\r\n",

If you need to do more complex scenarios like composite apps with multiple nested and sibling views, the built in routing starts to falter and you will probably land up developing something custom. Angular-ui/ui-router is ngRoute on steroids and provides a great way to address these sorts of problems. Come and kick the tires and take it out for a sprint or two. You will come away with a clear understanding of how this angular module can work for you and how to use it.",

We are building massive, complex systems that are non-trivial to maintain. Without the right approach, even the simplest change could cause hours of regression testing and debugging.\r\n\r\nThanks to smart people like Anna Debenham and Brad Frost, we know there is a better way. Front-end styleguides or pattern libraries are the key to creating and maintaining custom systems that are as simple to use as Twitter Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nIn this session, I&apos;ll talk about how to start a pattern library, how to create and organize the patterns, and how to maintain the system once it&apos;s up and running. I&apos;ll also highlight tools to make everything easier and show real-world examples of pattern libraries in action.",

However, web browsers these days continue to get better and are following web standards much more closely. Do we still need jQuery? Has it become a crutch? Can we get away with dropping jQuery as a dependency and use native browser APIs instead? In this session we will explain when it is appropriate to use jQuery and when you might be able to go without it. We will also briefly discuss why jQuery is a good idea and why you may not dismiss its value. If you decide to use jQuery then we will look at how you can make a custom build that only includes the parts you need. For the majority of this session we will be looking at common jQuery snippets and show how to convert them either using native browser APIs or utilizing popular micro-libraries.",

However, with great power also comes great power to do things incorrectly, which leads to many projects based on XAML technologies that are in trouble in some way. In this session Mike will take a look at XAML Anti-Patterns &#x2013; common solutions that end up being ineffective and counterproductive. Among the discussed patterns and techniques are things like bootstrappers, virtualization, resources, XAML itself, and much,  much more. Many of the presented topics may surprise even advanced XAML developers.",

		"title": "Event Sourcing and CQRS with a Fairy Tale Ending ",
		"summary": "As kids we learned everything we need to know about Event Sourcing and CQRS from Hansel and Gretel. All you need to do is follow the breadcrumbs! Real world applications are rarely simple enough to fit into the mold that cookie cutter tools provide. What happens when the requirements for that &apos;simple&apos; piece of software grow in a direction that is unexpected? Often the end of a project becomes a series of tradeoffs between performance and maintainability.  How can we write clean code that will solve our basic use case now and have enough flexibility to adapt to future requirements? In this talk you&#x2019;ll learn how Event Sourcing and CQRS can keep you on path and out of the oven. Along the way, I&#x2019;ll share some lessons learned from building a real application using these techniques.",
