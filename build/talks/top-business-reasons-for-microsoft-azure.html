	<h2>Top Business Reasons for Microsoft Azure</h2>
<p>All the Cloud technology bells and whistles aren&#x2019;t much help to you if they can&#x2019;t help you satisfy your customers, make or save money, or make your business successful. And as a key business or technical decision maker your career depends upon using sound judgment for key decisions.  In order to make the right assessment and decisions it&#x2019;s important that you grasp the primary and critical business drivers, as well as common fears and concerns, of which to be aware of when you are contemplating migrating your solutions into the Azure Cloud. The Cloud carries with it a different mindset with differences that range from economics to staffing to deployment to management.  It&#x2019;s frankly hard to make this transition. There is a lot to consider and plan for that the average enterprise IT leader may not be equipped to do. Items like Cloud SLAs for availability, disaster recovery, Time-to-Market, data privacy, vendor lock-in, self-service, economics, simplicity of deployment including globally, and leveraging your existing skills sets.

Join Aditi Senior Cloud Solutions Architect and Microsoft Azure MVP Mike McKeown as he shares the main business drivers and benefits, along with some potential pitfalls to consider, when company decision makers are considering a move to Microsoft Azure.

<h3>Mike McKeown</h3>
<p>As a Microsoft Azure Most Valuable Partner (MVP) I live and breathe the Cloud! I hold MS/BS (Magna Cum Laude) degrees in Computer Science, as well as numerous Microsoft certifications. I started out as an OS/2 Developer, and then advanced to Development Manager before joining Microsoft in 1993. While at Microsoft, I thoroughly enjoyed the challenging employment and have held many customer-related roles &#x2013; Senior Consultant, Technical Evangelist, Support Engineer, Technical Trainer, Solutions Architect Integration Engineer, and Senior Programming-Writer. The different job functions and experience this time has given me a unique breadth as well as depth of the IT environment from the view of development, management, infrastructure, sales, and the customer. 

I left Microsoft after almost two decades and moved into the area of Architecture. My passion is to help stakeholders or customers define their business/system requirements, and then apply Windows Azure or Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud architecture patterns and best practices to meet those goals. I love to blog (http://www.michaelmckeown.com) about the Azure Cloud! You may someday see me speak at numerous technical conferences. I develop Cloud courseware for Pluralsight in my spare time. And finally... I also served my country for 23 years as a Naval Engineering Duty Officer.
